<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1/4 tsp instant yeast</li>
    <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
    <li>1 tbs olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>181 grams fresh water</li>
    <li>278 grams bread flour</li>
</ul>

<h4>Recipe</h4>

<ol>
    <li>Heat fresh water to 100-110 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, pour your water, yeast, and sugar. Let sit for 5 minutes to bloom yeast.</li>
    <li>Once yeast is frothy, pour your flour in and begin to mix by hand or with a tool of choice.</li>
    <li>After a minute or two, your dough should be a nice shaggy ball of dough. It's okay if there are some pieces that won't stick yet.</li>
    <li>Add the oil and salt and begin to knead the dough inside the bowl with your hand.</li>
    <li>After 2-3 minutes, take your ball of dough to the counter and knead it for an additional 5-10 minutes.</li>
    <li>You'll know your dough is good when you can poke it and it bounces back!</li>
    <li>Form a doughball and place the ball into an oiled bowl. Let rest for 2-6 hours at room temperature. Make sure your cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a lid so the dough doesn't dry out.</li>
    <li>After several hours, you dough should have risen. You can now punch down the dough to release the gasses.</li>
    <li>This dough makes 2 medium pizzas - take your dough and separate.</li>
    <li>Shape your pizza dough and top with whatever you like!</li>
</ol>
