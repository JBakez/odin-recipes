<p>Well, you probably couldn't tell from my well structured website and perfect English grammar but... I'm a cat! I'm sorry if this offends anyone. I've been a home cook for about 2 human years (14 cat years) and have gained a lot of experience just from watching Youtube videos! Some of my favorites are Mythical Kitchen, Joshua Weissman, and Binging with Babish. Anyways, I hope you enjoy my recipe blog, my recipes, and the time you spend with your loved ones while eating them!</p>
