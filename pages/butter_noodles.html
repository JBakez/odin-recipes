<p>My butter noodles topped with lemony chicken is the perfect addition to your dinner lineup! Lots of creamy butter, fresh herbs, and perfectly cooked chicken with a twist of lemon. This recipe will impress anyone you are cooking for!</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<ul>
    <li>4 tbs high quality butter</li>
    <li>1/2 cup chopped parsley</li>
    <li>6 oz of noodle of choice (I use angel hair!)</li>
    <li>3/4 reserved pasta water</li>
    <li>6-8 oz of chicken breast</li>
    <li>Garlic powder</li>
    <li>Onion powder</li>
    <li>Chili powder</li>
    <li>1 lemon</li>
</ul>

<h4>Recipe</h4>

<ol>
    <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil.</li>
    <li>While that is coming to heat, pound your chicken breast out thin and season to taste with garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, and salt.</li>
    <li>Place your chicken in an air fryer preheated to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Cook for 8-10 minutes until chicken has reached an internal temp of 165 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
    <li>Chop your parsley and set aside.</li>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, put the 4 tbs of butter in and zest your lemon over the butter</li>
    <li>Place your noodles in the water and cook according to package instructions.</li>
    <li>Remove chicken from air fryer, let rest for 5 minutes, and slice into thin pieces.</li>
    <li>Remove 3/4 cup of pasta water from cooking noodles and drain the noodles.</li>
    <li>Dump the noodles into the large bowl with the butter and stir until butter is melted.</li>
    <li>Add parsley.</li>
    <li>While stirring, add the pasta water slowly to emulsify the butter into a creamy sauce. You may not have to use all the water.</li>
    <li>When the butter noodles have a creamy texture, plate and top with sliced chicken.</li>
    <li>Squeeze lemon juice over the chicken and serve.</li>
</ol>
